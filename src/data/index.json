The cells can be in one of 3 states and the simulation progresses by applying game rules that govern cell birth, deaths, and transitions. Players can take turns modifying the grid by removing or adding their own pieces with the intention to simulate multiple generations. Includes pattern loading from external files, player driven input, custom cell rules, and visual representation through text based grid.",

Over the course of two sessions, I led a team to deliver a weeklong intensive curriculum to over 10 students, teaching them not just syntax and logic but also how to turn their ideas into tangible projects. From marketing the program to planning lesson content and managing finances, I took ownership of the entire process. This experience was done out of my passion for teaching, leadership, and fostering computational literacy in my community."

Together, we developed a sophisticated detection system powered by natural language processing and logistic regression. By implementing methods such as Bag-of-Words and GloVe representations, we significantly enhanced the modelâ€™s prediction accuracy. The program culminated in a detailed presentation, where I showcased our results and insights to a large audience of fellow scholars. This experience deepened my understanding of AI's transformative potential and reinforced my commitment to leveraging technology for societal impact."
