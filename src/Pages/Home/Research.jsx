                        I am currently involved with the Yongmin group under Dr. Yongmin Liu and PhD student Alex McNeil. My work is focused on Free Space Optical Neural Networks (FSONN).

                        I support ongoing research by shadowing experienced researchers and contributing to the codebase. My work involves assisting in the enhancement of FSONN algorithms and developing small but impactful code improvements to optimize system performance. Through this experience, I am gaining hands-on knowledge in photonics, meta-materials, computer engineering, machine learning, and neural network frameworks while honing my skills in programming and data analysis.
